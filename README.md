# Machine-Learning-on-MNIST-Handwritten-Dataset
Implementation of Least Squares Classification and K-Means Clustering on to recognize images of hand written digits

Implented using only Python std libraries and numpy. + matpltlib/pandas for visualizations

*work in progress: Create GUI to predict hand written digits from user input in real time. Maybe convert to tensorflow neural network for efficiency.
